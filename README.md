# csv-comparer
App that takes 2 CSV files and compare the intersection and the difference between them.
I use it to make the difference between Instagram followers and following's.

Will add feature to get Instagram followers in the future. At the moment, Instagram API doesn't allow this so I must probably go with a scaper. Currently I use Bardeen Chrome extension for scraping followers.
